Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., `HWD`).
```bash
git clone  https://github.com/angular/quickstart  HWD
cd HWD
```

## Install npm packages

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

**Attention Windows Developers:  You must run all of these commands in administrator mode**

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command first compiles the application, 
then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.
Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

You're ready to write your application.
